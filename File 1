Dropshipping is a type of order fulfillment method where a store doesnt keep the actual items. Instead, the store buys the items from third-party suppliers like
manufacturer, wholesaler or distributer and makes it transported to the customers. Thus, vendor doestn't need to deal with the acutal items.

b) Then vendor pay the supplier or manufacturer wholesale price for product $50.
c) Then the suppliers or manufacturer transport the product to the end customers and vendor keeps the profit amount of $30.
